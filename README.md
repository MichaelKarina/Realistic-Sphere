# 🌐 Realistic Rotating Sphere with Three.js

Hey friends, I'm Michael Karina. A few days ago, we made a rotating sphere. Today, we're going to make this look even more realistic. 🚀

## 🌟 Overview

This project utilizes the Three.js library to create and configure a 3D scene with a rotating sphere. The project is split into two main files:

- **`app.js`**: Handles the creation and configuration of the Three.js scene, including the initialization of the scene, camera, and WebGL renderer. It also includes the rendering loop that continuously updates and renders the scene, animating the sphere by rotating it each frame.
- **`index.js`**: Serves as the entry point for the application, importing and setting up `app.js`. It initializes the application, manages the rendering loop, and integrates other components to ensure the scene is properly displayed and animated on the web page.

## 📚 Three.js Library

Three.js is a powerful library that simplifies the creation and rendering of 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for handling complex 3D tasks, including rendering settings and user interactions.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MichaelKarina/realistic-rotating-sphere.git
   cd realistic-rotating-sphere
2. Install dependencies (if any):
   npm install
3.Open index.html in your web browser to see the rotating sphere in action.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **'app.js'**: Contains the Three.js scene setup and animation logic.
- **'Three.js'**: Entry point of the application, integrates app.js and manages the rendering loop.
- **'index.html'**: HTML file that includes the necessary script tags to load index.js and display the 3D scene.
